# Holder Core

The HolderCoreHandler class implements the core capabilities of an Aries Cloud Agent for the holder agent. It includes methods to send credential proposal, offer, issue, and acknowledgement messages to a connection, as well as handlers for receiving credential request and credential messages. The process_credential_request and process_credential methods are not shown, but they would handle the actual processing of these messages based on the specific use case of the agent.
